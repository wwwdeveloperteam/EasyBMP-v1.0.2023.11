# EasyBMP v1.0.2023.11

EasyBMP is a simple, cross-platform, open source (revised BSD) C++ library designed for easily reading, writing, and modifying Windows bitmap (BMP) image files. You can learn more about the history and goals of the project here. The library is oriented towards the novice programmer with little formal experience, but it is sufficiently capable for anybody who desires to do I/O and pixel operations on uncompressed 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 bpp (bits per pixel) BMP files.
